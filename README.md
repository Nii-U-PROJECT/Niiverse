1. Please, don't. Niiverse was supposed to be private, and plus it probably won't get hosted until 2055. (Never)

## About
Niiverse is a Miiverse Clone, based off Indigo. You can use the original Indigo code, but not Niiverse's. If you do, you will have to take it down. It also was supposed to be based off Cedar, then Uiiverse and now Indigo.
